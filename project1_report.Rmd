## Inspo meme
![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSsx8v5JnZSF5xaY_VgzuxpSvs_ZaTZvlW9IA&s)

***Key components:***
The key components of my inspo meme are that it involves a text that covers a little bit of the meme
and the rest is an image of a fighter(Leon Edwards) getting slammed on his head by his opponent(Belal Muhammad)

## My meme

***Changes:***
The changes I have made are the images but kept the same text. The reason I have made this change is because the text relates to both photos to where they're hard to explain to a viewer without context of what's going on, hence why it says "you're probably wondering how I got here.the term "You're probably wondering how I got here" is often used before a dramatic action occurs.

## Creativity
When looking at the background color of my memes they have white spaces in between the text and photos, to ensure that the meme looks incomplete or ridiculous I made the background color black so that the difference between the meme and the background color are differentiated. The text colour is white because it provides high contrast and readability to the user. I've also used a contrast checker where you can compare background with foreground and see if your colour combination works well together. Black as the background and white as the foreground has a maxed our rating based on their criteria (21:1).

## Learning reflection
An important idea I learnt from module 1 was being able to re-use and combine R functions create a desired product. This project has shown and taught me on how to mix different software/systems to create products, not only has it taught me on how to apply css and markdown into R studio but I've also learnt on how to use them in general. These types of skills will stick and help excel not only my learning but my work when using them in different environements.

I would like to learn about data generating, importing, wrangling and visualising data. I believe these are all essential functions when it comes to working with data.

## Appendix

<mark>Do not change, edit, or remove the `R` chunk included below.</mark> 

If you are working within RStudio and within your Project1 RStudio project (check the top right-hand corner says "Project1"), then the code from the `meme.R` script will be displayed below.

This code needs to be visible for your project to be marked appropriately, as some of the criteria are based on this code being submitted.


```{r file='meme.R', eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

```
